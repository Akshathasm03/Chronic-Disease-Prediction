## 🏥 Multiple Disease Prediction Streamlit App
This repository contains the codebase for the **Multiple Disease Prediction Streamlit App**, a machine-learning-powered tool that predicts the likelihood of various chronic diseases based on user input. The project includes training notebooks and datasets organized in respective folders.

---

## 🚀 Features
✅ Predicts multiple chronic diseases using trained ML models  
✅ User-friendly **Streamlit UI** for seamless interaction  
✅ Pre-trained models with provided datasets  
✅ Simple and efficient deployment  
✅ Open-source and customizable  

---

## 🛠 Installation & Setup
Ensure you have **Python 3.7+** installed before proceeding.

### 1️⃣ Install Required Packages
Run the following command to install Streamlit and other dependencies:
```sh
pip install streamlit
pip install streamlit-option-menu
```

Alternatively, install all dependencies at once using:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2️⃣ Navigate to the Project Directory
```sh
cd File_name  # Replace 'File_name' with your project directory name
```

### 3️⃣ Run the Streamlit App
```sh
streamlit run app.py
```
